The goal of **supercells** is to bring the idea of superpixels into spatial analysis - grouping raster cells (not just image pixels) into meaningful, coherent regions.
This package works on spatial data with one variable (e.g., continuous raster), many variables (e.g., RGB rasters), and spatial patterns (e.g., areas in categorical rasters).
It is based on the SLIC algorithm (Achanta et al. (2012)), adapted to work with arbitrary dissimilarity measures and multidimensional data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of supercells from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("supercells")
```

You can install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("supercells", repos = "https://nowosad.r-universe.dev")
```

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("remotes") -->
<!-- remotes::install_github("Nowosad/supercells") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
library(supercells)
library(terra)
library(sf)
vol = rast(system.file("raster/volcano.tif", package = "supercells"))
plot(vol)
```

Here, `step` controls the approximate spacing between supercell centers, and `compactness` allows to balance spatial proximity versus value similarity.

```{r}
#| results: 'hide'
vol_slic1 = sc_slic(vol, step = 8, compactness = 7)
plot(vol)
plot(st_geometry(vol_slic1), add = TRUE, lwd = 0.5, border = "red")
```

## Documentation

Version 2 (in development) focuses on a clearer workflow, better diagnostics, and more guidance on choosing parameters and interpreting results.
