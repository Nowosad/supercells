This vignette shows how to evaluate supercells and interpret the diagnostics.
The metrics quantify spatial compactness, value homogeneity, and their balance.

All examples use the `volcano` raster for simplicity, but the same workflow applies to multi-layer rasters.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(supercells)
library(terra)

vol <- terra::rast(system.file("raster/volcano.tif", package = "supercells"))
vol_sc <- sc_slic(vol, step = 8, compactness = 7)
```

# Pixel metrics

Pixel metrics provide a map of distances from each pixel to its supercell center.
They are useful for diagnosing local failures, such as areas where the supercells are too large or too irregular.
Pixel metrics are provided with the `sc_metrics_pixels()` function, which accepts the original raster and the supercell polygons^[This function reads supercells parameters internally from the `supercell` object, so it does not require the `step`, `compactness`, or `dist_fun` arguments], and returns a multi-layer raster with the requested metrics.

The pixel metrics include four layers^[Use the `metrics` argument to request a subset of metrics], each with a specific interpretation:

1. `spatial` is the distance from each pixel to its supercell center in grid-cell units (unless the input supercells were created with `step_unit = "map"`, in which case distances are reported in map units).
Lower spatial values indicate cells that are closer to the center and more compact supercells, while higher values indicate cells that are farther from the center and may indicate irregular shapes or outliers.
2. `value` is the distance from each pixel to its supercell center in the value space defined by your `dist_fun`.
Lower value distances indicate more homogeneous supercells, while higher values indicate more heterogeneous supercells or outliers.
3. `combined` blends spatial and value terms using `step` and `compactness`, and is mainly useful for ranking pixels or supercells within a single run -- it is not directly comparable across runs with different parameters or distance functions.
4. `balance` is the signed log ratio of scaled value to spatial distance, so negative values indicate spatial dominance and positive values indicate value dominance.

By default, `sc_metrics_pixels()` returns `spatial`, `value`, `combined`, and `balance`, and uses `scale = TRUE`.
With scaling on, the spatial and value layers are returned as `spatial_scaled` and `value_scaled`.
Scaling divides spatial distance by `step` (or by `step` in map units) and value distance by `compactness` (or by per-supercell values for SLIC0).
This makes the spatial and value components comparable and keeps the balance metric interpretable.
If you want raw units, set `scale = FALSE`.

```{r}
pixel_metrics <- sc_metrics_pixels(vol, vol_sc)
terra::plot(pixel_metrics, nc = 3)
```

# Supercell metrics

Metrics on the supercell level summarize each polygon with a single value for each metric.
They are useful for quality screening, outlier detection, or joining metrics to attributes.
They are calculated with the `sc_metrics_supercells()` function, which accepts the original raster and the supercell polygons, and returns an `sf` object with one row per supercell and the requested metrics as columns.

The supercell metrics include four variables, each with a specific interpretation:

1. `mean_spatial_dist` is the average spatial distance from pixels to the supercell center. Lower values indicate more compact shapes.
2. `mean_value_dist` is the average value distance from pixels to the supercell center in the value space defined by `dist_fun`.
Lower values indicate more homogeneous supercells.
3. `mean_combined_dist` blends spatial and value terms using `step` and `compactness`, and is mainly useful for ranking supercells within a single run.
4. `balance` is the signed log ratio of scaled value to scaled spatial distance, so negative values indicate spatial dominance and positive values indicate value dominance.

```{r}
supercell_metrics <- sc_metrics_supercells(vol, vol_sc)
head(supercell_metrics)
```

The output is an `sf` object with one row per supercell and the metrics as columns.
You can map any metric by plotting a single column.

```{r}
plot(supercell_metrics)
```

# Global metrics

Global metrics provide a single-row summary and are best for comparing different outputs or parameter settings.
They are calculated with `sc_metrics_global()`, which accepts the original raster and the supercell polygons and returns a `data.frame`.
In these metrics, each supercell contributes equally to the global averages.^[If you want to weight by area or number of pixels, you can use the supercell-level metrics and calculate your own weighted averages. Also, let us know if you want a built-in option for weighted global metrics.]

The global metrics include the same four distance summaries as the supercell metrics:

1. `mean_spatial_dist` is the average spatial distance from pixels to their supercell centers.
Lower values indicate more compact shapes.
2. `mean_value_dist` is the average value distance from pixels to their supercell centers in the value space defined by `dist_fun`.
Lower values indicate more homogeneous supercells.
3. `mean_combined_dist` blends spatial and value terms using `step` and `compactness`, and is mainly useful for ranking or comparing runs.
4. `balance` is the mean signed log ratio of scaled value to scaled spatial distance, so negative values indicate spatial dominance and positive values indicate value dominance.

By default, `sc_metrics_global()` returns the scaled distances.
When `scale = TRUE`, the spatial and value summaries are returned as `mean_spatial_dist_scaled` and `mean_value_dist_scaled`.
If you want raw units, set `scale = FALSE`.

```{r}
global_metrics <- sc_metrics_global(vol, vol_sc)
global_metrics
```

You may use the global metrics to compare parameter settings, for example by varying `step` or `compactness`.
However, remember to keep the same `dist_fun` that you used for the supercell generation to make comparisons meaningful.
Higher compactness typically lowers spatial distances while increasing value distances, so look for balanced tradeoffs rather than a single minimum.

```{r}
vol_sc_low <- sc_slic(vol, step = 8, compactness = 1)
metrics_higher <- sc_metrics_global(vol, vol_sc)
metrics_lower <- sc_metrics_global(vol, vol_sc_low)
rbind(higher_compactness = metrics_higher, lower_compactness = metrics_lower)
```

When using `compactness = "auto"`, the value scaling is per-supercell.
This improves local adaptation, but it also means metrics are not directly comparable to fixed-compactness outputs. 
In this case, you can still compare the spatial metrics, but the value metrics will reflect the local scaling rather than the original value distances.
