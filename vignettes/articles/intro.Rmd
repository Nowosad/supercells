Goal: quick overview of the core API and outputs.
Keep it short; link out to the other vignettes for details.
-->

# What this package does

<!--
Explain SLIC-based supercells, typical use cases, and the core workflow.
-->

# Core functions

<!--
Introduce sc_slic() as the main engine.
Briefly mention sc_slic_points() and sc_slic_raster() as alternate outputs.
-->

# Minimal example

<!--
Show a tiny example (small raster, few steps).
Keep runtime light and avoid large data.
-->

# Where to go next

<!--
Link to the workflow, tuning, and evaluation vignettes.
